# Stytch Take Home Task

In this project, we are using Stytch's JS SDK to build a replacement login flow for Chase Bank. By doing this, we are eliminating the use of a password and using an Email Magic Link system, and SMS OTP for login. 

Please feel free to fork/clone this project!

First, install your dependencies by using:

### `npm install`

Then, to start the app, use:

### `npm start`
